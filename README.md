### Dashboard Link :


## Overview/Problem Statement
Superstore is a fictional national retail company. In this project, I developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard for a fictional national retail chain to deliver actionable insights on sales performance, customer behavior, and product profitability. The primary goal was to create an executive-level tool that enables data-driven decisions around growth strategies, marketing investment, and inventory planning.


## Business Questions:
- Are sales growing/stalling?
- Which products drive the most profit?
- Are there products that are frequently bought together?
- Where should the marketing budget be focused?
- Which customer segments should we target more?
- Are our marketing campaigns yielding positive ROI?
- How to increase profit margins across stores and products?
- What are the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)?
