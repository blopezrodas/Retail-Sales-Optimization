### Dashboard Link :


## Overview/Problem Statement
Superstore is a fictional national retail company. In this project, I developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard for a fictional national retail chain to deliver actionable insights on sales performance, customer behavior, and product profitability. The primary goal was to create an executive-level tool that enables data-driven decisions around growth strategies, marketing investment, and inventory planning.


## Business Questions:
#### Executive Summary
- How is the business performing in terms of sales and profit?
- Are sales and profits increasing or declining month-over-month (MoM) and year-over-year (YoY)?
- How is the business performing this period compared to previous periods?

#### Regional Analysis
- Which regions, states, and cities generate the most revenue and profit?
- Are there regions/states/cities with high sales but low profitability?
- Where should we focus sales efforts or cost optimization?

#### Product Performance
- Which product categories and sub-categories contribute most revenue and profit?
- Are there low-margin or underperforming products?
- What are the trends in product demand?

#### Customer Segment Analysis
- Who are our most valuable customers?
- How often do customers purchase, and how much do they typically spend?

- Which customers are at risk of churning?
